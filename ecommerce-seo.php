Before that advertisement can be effective, you have to send it out. By implementing SEO strategies and tactics on your website, you make it easy for web surfers to find your site and see what your business has to offer. An outstanding website is great to have, but potential customers must be able to find it easily!

SEO is a gradual process that requires consistent effort and optimization over time. It may take several months to see significant results.There are a wide variety of factors that play into the amount of time it will take for your search engine rankings and traffic to improve. Those factors include the competitiveness of your industry, how long your site has existed, and where you currently rank. For example, if you are on page 5 we will work to move you to page 1, but through this process, you will go from page 5, to page 3 and eventually to page 1. As we make progress, traffic typically doesn’t increase until we hit the first page of the search results.

Depending on your industry, different tactics and eCommerce SEO strategies will apply. For example, many manufacturers or part dealers drive organic search traffic by ranking for SKU numbers and part numbers, while in other industries, part numbers may not be commonly searched. We will work to first identify which keywords we need to target for your product pages, then implement a strategy that matches. We also utilize dynamic optimization tactics that can make changes on all product pages at once, allowing us to ‘SEO’ hundreds or thousands of product pages simultaneously. The end goal is to drive customers from the product page to checkout as quickly as possible.
