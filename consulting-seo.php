                <p class="pt-3">SEO consultants are a must during a website redesign! With so many moving parts, structure changes, and decisions to be made, your SEO consultant needs to be there every step of the way making sure the decisions are best for your SEO efforts. When these decisions go unchecked, often designers, developers, and other members of the redesign team overlook critical elements. Remember, every piece of code and content makes an impact on your rankings, so each decision needs a sign-off. We’ll also manage the 301 redirect process, an absolute must if you don’t want your rankings to take a sharp drop post-launch.</p>

                <h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Verify SEO Experience: </h6>
                <div>
                    <p>The SEO landscape is complex and requires substantial experience to navigate a campaign effectively. When hiring an SEO consultant, ensure they have a proven track record of success in different industries and a comprehensive understanding of Google’s latest algorithm updates. For example, if you’re an enterprise brand, be sure they are experienced in Enterprise SEO campaigns.</p>
                </div>
                <h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Check For Customized Strategy Approach: </h6>
                <div>
                    <p> Avoid consultants who offer “one-size-fits-all” SEO strategies or boiler plate SEO packages. Each business is unique and requires a customized approach to search marketing. The right consultant should analyze your business’s specific needs and create a tailored strategy. Ask for the consultant to present a part of their strategy, or an overview of the game plan.</p>
                </div>
                <h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Evaluate Their Technical Knowledge: </h6>
                <div>
                    <p> SEO involves many technical aspects, such as site speed, mobile optimization, and structured data. Your consultant should demonstrate strong technical knowledge to identify and resolve any technical issues that may hinder your site’s performance. If you want to check your own site speed use PageSpeed Insights.</p>
                </div>
                <h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Assess Communication Skills: </h6>
                <div>
                    <p> Clear and regular communication is crucial to keep you updated about your campaign progress. Your consultant should be transparent, articulate, and able to explain complex SEO concepts in an easy-to-understand manner. They should also provide reporting that is clear and concise.</p>
                </div>
                <h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Ask For References: </h6>
                <div>
                    <p> A reputable SEO consultant should be able to provide references or case studies from past clients. This will give you an idea of their work style, reliability, and effectiveness.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-body">It’s simple. An SEO consultant works with your team to provide SEO strategy and ideas. We can also help implement SEO work as needed. An expert consultant will work with your internal team to create a plan and be an extension of your team. The goal is to raise your keywords to the top of the search engines, driving more organic traffic and conversions. If a consultant does their job, you should see a positive return on your investment much greater than you’d receive via other online advertising channels.

However, as your rankings improve, your brand’s overall visibility will improve, too. The goal of SEO is to obtain page 1 rankings for your keywords. In the meantime, hitting milestones such as moving up from page 7 to page 4 are indicators of good SEO traction and tactics that are working. All of our best clients stick with SEO for the long term and maintain their SEO efforts to keep their top rankings.
