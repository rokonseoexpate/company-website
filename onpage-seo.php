				<p class="pt-3">On-page SEO is an iterative process, continually evolving and adapting to changes in search engine algorithms and user behaviors. It's an ongoing effort to refine and improve your website's performance in search engine results pages (SERPs). This iterative approach involves regularly monitoring your site's analytics to identify areas for optimization and opportunities for improvement. </p>

Additionally, you might conduct A/B testing to compare different versions of your pages. Hence, it will help to determine which elements, such as headlines or calls to action, yield the best results. However, we want to make sure you understand the theory behind them. There are three main categories of tactics and techniques:</p>

				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Crawler Accessibility </h6>
				<div>
					<p>To optimize your on-page SEO, you need to ensure that Google’s web crawlers can access your site. Therefore, these bots are like scouts that Google uses to explore the web and index information. If your site is inaccessible to these crawlers, Google won’t be able to index it. Several potential reasons contribute to this issue: </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Several factors that might prevent bots from accessing your site are: </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="text-success"><strong>1. A server-side error is blocking the bots from reaching your site.</strong></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="text-success"><strong>2. Your site is offline or unreachable to any user.</strong></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="text-success"><strong>3. You have unintentionally prevented web crawlers from accessing your site in your robots.txt file (see below for more details).</strong></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>A related point is that various web crawlers exist. Some belong to Google, while others are from other major search engines and tech companies like Bing and Apple. These are some of the most relevant ones from Google:</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Your site should be easy to crawl unless there is a problem with your site or server. In fact, it is more difficult to prevent Googlebot and other search engine bots from accessing your site. It may take some time for your site to appear in Google's index if it is new. Therefore, don't worry if you don't see your site in the search results yet.</p>

				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">URL Structure</h6>
				<div>
					<p>The structure of your URLs can influence your on-page SEO, including your site's appearance and your pages' rankings. Google prefers sites with simple and clear URLs that help users find their way, and descriptive text that informs Google about the web page's content.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="text-success">1. Use static URLs instead of dynamic ones. Dynamic URLs can confuse Google's index and may suggest a dishonest practice.</p>

					<h6>Robots.Txt</h6>
				</div>
				<p class="pt-3">A robots.txt file is a guide for search engine bots that you can place in your top-level directory. It indicates which pages they can crawl and index, and which ones they should skip. By default, web crawlers index your whole site. But you might have some pages that you want to keep out of the index (e.g., pages with duplicate content). Before accessing any page on your site, a bot will look at the reference: www.yoursite.com/robots.txt. Moreover, this will specify a User-agent and some pages with a Disallow tag.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				<p>The User-agent specification allows you to specifically exclude certain bots or to apply restrictions broadly. By employing the Disallow option, you can keep undesired pages out of search engine indexes. This is mostly necessary if you face issues with canonical URLs. Additionally, if there's a webpage that poses a threat to your primary SEO strategies on-page, it is also helpful. If neither applies, maintaining an unaltered robots.txt file is perfectly acceptable.</p>
				<p>Review your work carefully to ensure that you have not inadvertently blocked all search bots from accessing your whole site. This is a common mistake. A word of caution: do not attempt to conceal negative or harmful content. Robots.txt directives are open to the public.A robots.txt file is important for controlling how search engines crawl your website. However, you can make sure your robots.txt file is error-free and works as intended. You can use Google's free tester tool to check it.</p>

					<h6>Sitemap Provision</h6>
				</div>
				<p class="pt-3">There are two essential varieties of sitemaps that can enhance your website's SEO: HTML and XML sitemaps. Their overall impact on SEO is a matter of discussion yet crafting them is likely to be beneficial. HTML sitemaps serve both visitors and search engine bots and are typically located in the website's footer. Therefore, it ensures that every page is accessible from anywhere on the site. You can upload XML sitemaps directly to Google using the "add/test sitemap" feature in the "Sitemaps" section of the Google Search Console. It demands a bit more technical expertise.</p>
				<p>A good resource for learning more about XML sitemaps is Sitemaps.org. It provides an excellent example of a sitemap that Google would accept. If your sitemap has any problems, Google will notify you.Your site is not static—it changes frequently as you add, remove, or modify pages. Therefore, you should update your site maps regularly. If you want some extra assistance, you can use one of the many popular site crawlers online.</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Observe how the question and the supposed answer are phrased, separated from the rest of the search results. This is called a "rich answer", and it is part of Google's Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Graph is not a repository of information, but rather a network that accesses information from other websites. For example, my query "How many US citizens are there" made Google find the answer on the Wikipedia page "Demography of the United States". However, Google cannot do this by itself. It needs assistance from webmasters to properly classify and submit information by implementing appropriate structured data.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>For webmasters, this represents a notable chance to enhance search engine rankings. Though it doesn't influence domain authority directly, it offers the opportunity to feature information prominently above regular search outcomes. Micro formatting, or structured data, is the method to categorize your content effectively.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>In essence, it's a coding format utilized on websites to guide Google in understanding various types of data, including events, people, organizations, actions, reviews, and more. Though it can become quite technically intricate (deserving a dedicated discussion), I'll refrain from delving deeper into structured data specifics here. Nevertheless, Schema.org serves as a primary reference for microformatting, providing comprehensive instructions on its integration into your website. This significantly increases the likelihood that featured snippets will highlight your content or that your content will secure position zero.</p>

				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">How to Optimize Titles and Meta Descriptions for On-Page SEO</h6>
				<div>
					<p>In this article, we will discuss the importance of page titles and descriptions for SEO. Look at the following example: </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>The above image shows a search result for "SEO.co" and as expected, our website is the first one to show up. Notice the parts of the entry that are highlighted. The headline, which contains a link, is the title tag of this page, while the brief description below it is the meta description. Title tags and meta descriptions have two main functions in SEO:</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Page title tags help Google understand your content's topic. For example, a page title tag like "Why dogs bark at cars" tells Google that your page answers this question. This makes your page more relevant for a search like "why is my dog barking at cars."</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Your site's appearance in search listings can make or break users' first impressions. You need to capture their attention and curiosity with a compelling start. </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">For all pages, your titles and descriptions should have these qualities:</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">1. Unique</strong> Use different titles and descriptions for each page, even if it takes more time. To find duplicate meta descriptions, go to Google Search Console (GSC) and select Search Appearance > HTML Improvements. </p>

					<p><strong class="text-success">2. Be accurate.</strong> Use relevant keywords to describe your content as precisely as you can. However, avoid using too many keywords or repeating them unnecessarily; only use them where they fit naturally. Keyword stuffing is a bad practice. </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">3. Branded.</strong> Ensure your brand name follows the primary keyword phrase and page title, adopting a “Primary keyword phrase and page title | Brand name” format for most web pages.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">4. Compelling.</strong> Keep in mind, the goal is to satisfy both users, by matching their search intent, and search engines alike.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>To summarize, web page titles and meta descriptions have some similarities, but also some key differences. Here are the main ones:</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">5. Titles matter a lot.</strong> They affect how both search engines and users perceive your content, so you should optimize them as much as possible. You can be more flexible with descriptions.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">6. The titles and descriptions have different length requirements.</strong> Google will cut off your material if you exceed the firm character limit. You should try to avoid this, but it's not a big deal if it happens sometimes. The limit is 75 characters for titles and 160 for descriptions.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Header tags are another important element of your web page. They are numbered from H1 to H6 and show the main topics of your content—like a summary. To help search engines understand and index your content better, you should use relevant keywords and meta data in your header tags. Meta data includes a good meta description, which is a short paragraph that describes what your page is about. Header tags have more weight than regular body text, so they can affect your ranking.</p>

				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Keyword Density (Target, Entity & LSI Keywords)</h6>
				<div>
					<p>In on-page SEO ranking, the role of keywords is vital. The conversation about keywords leads us to emphasize:</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">Exact Match Keywords</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">Partial Match Keywords</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">Entity Keywords</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">LSI (latent semantic indexing) keywords</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Keyword density plays a significant role in search engine rankings, extending beyond just the text in paragraphs. It's essential to incorporate a well-balanced mix of exact match, partial match, entity, and LSI keywords within your bolded, italicized texts, and headings (H1-H6) to optimize your page effectively.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Despite the potential risks of keyword stuffing, it's entirely feasible to maintain robust on-page SEO rankings, even if your content seems to flirt with grammatical limits. Your exact match keywords should fall between 7 to 12% density, though this may vary based on your competitors' strategies in the top 10 rankings. Be vigilant with your keyword density; surpassing 12% could be perceived by search engines as an attempt to manipulate rankings. Meanwhile, densities for exact match, entity, and LSI keywords should be kept within 3 to 7%. Reach out for an on-page SEO audit to uncover where you might be falling short of your competition.</p>

				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">URL Structures</h6>
				<div>
					<p>In the previous section on Indexation, we extensively covered the components of a strong URL, hence I won't revisit those details. Nonetheless, it's crucial to underscore the necessity of having well-structured URLs for every page to enhance on-page SEO. Always strive to keep URLs concise, ideally under 90 characters, when creating new pages.</p>
				</div>
				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">On Page SEO Content</h6>
				<div>
					<p>The content on your page provides crucial insights to Google about what your page is about. Although it often acts as additional context to the more critical elements like titles, descriptions, and headers discussed earlier. However, it is not advisable to overlook the SEO content on your page. Ensure that every page on your site includes at least 100 words of detailed content. Failing to provide this minimum may indicate that a page shouldn't exist. This content presents three significant opportunities.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">By providing enough content, you demonstrate your consideration for your audience. Users won't get satisfaction with web pages that lack sufficient information, so Google won't rank them highly.</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">Blogging frequently allows you to display more keywords. Besides the keywords in title, description, and headers, you can also use different and similar terms of keyword phrase. You can get benefit from these semantic search patterns. However, avoid over-optimizing; only use terms that fit naturally.</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">Your content can attract inbound links from other sites, which boosts your authority. However, you need to provide valuable content that others find worth linking to.</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong class="text-success">The term “quality” content depends on various factors, which are too numerous to mention here. However, these basic tips can help you begin in a good direction.</strong> </p>
				</div>
				<h6 class="fw-bold fs-5 pb-3">Insights on Duplicate Content</h6>
				<div>
					<p>A crucial point to remember is that every piece of content on your website must be unique—not repeated within your site or identified as a duplicate by Copyscape. Sometimes, variations in URL formats (for example, http:// compared to https://) can cause Google to mistakenly index a page more than once, considering it duplicate content, which is a negative outcome.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>The good news is that this issue is easy to identify and address. Just visit Google Search Console, proceed to Search Appearance > HTML Improvements, and there you can generate a comprehensive list of duplicate content. Then, you have the option to block individual instances of duplication through your robots.txt file or apply 301 redirects to achieve proper link canonicalization.</p>
